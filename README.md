## Project Description
This weeks project is about the world-famous card game of Blackjack, which is also sometimes referred to as 21. The project is about building one's own game and therefore our first software. The game interacts with the user, using functions and basic python resources. Further, like a real game of Blackjack, the game will be able to take an input from the player and provide an output according to the Blackjack rules. 

## Rules
The player plays against the dealer. The player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. If he reaches exactly 21, it is called Blackjack and the player won. If the dealer is over the count of 21 or under the count of the player, the player wins the match. If the player goes over 21, he/she is busted and loses the game.

## Workflow / Organization
Firstly, I googled Blackjack to familiarize myself with the game. After understanding the game, I searched for resources and wrote down what is necessary to build that game within Python. I made a checklist with all the variables that need to be defined. Within my Jupyter Notebook, I created comments and the filled those comments with the actual commands. After my 10th mental breakdown I finally managed to create a game of Blackjack that actually works.
